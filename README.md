In this project, I implemented RFM analysis to improve customer retention, sepecificially:
1. Used Pandas for Data Preparation: Cleaned and preprocessed customer data using Pandas library to ensure data quality and prepare it for analysis.
2. RFM Segmentation analysis: Implemented the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis using Python. This involved calculating R, F, and M scores for each customer based on their purchase history (how recently they bought, how often they bought, and how much they spent). These scores were then used to segment customers into distinct groups based on their buying behaviors.
3. Visual Insights into Customer Segments: Created Treemaps and Histograms to visualize the distribution of customers across different RFM segments. These visualizations helped understand the characteristics of each segment, such as their purchase frequency, total order value, and contribution to overall sales revenue.
4. Customer Retention Focus: Analyzed the segmentation results to identify customer groups at risk of churn (those less likely to repurchase). This valuable insight allows for targeted marketing campaigns and retention strategies to be implemented, ultimately improving customer loyalty and lifetime value.
